Dingo-Productions_Dinosaur-Adventure_Yee

The original clip from the Yee meme (2010) based on the Dingo Productions movie called Dinosaur Adventure, a low budget movie that is considered a knockoff the 1988 movie The Land Before Time. I don't know when the movie was created, as I am having difficulty finding information, I am guessing it to be 1992. I include 2 variants, the original, and the meme version. currently, only a video version is available. Separate audio versions will be created in the future.
