- On 2024, Wednesday, October 9th, the Internet Archive was hit with a massive DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack, and 31 million accounts were affected in a data breach. As of writing this, the site is still mostly unresponsive, with partial functionality.
- - As of 2024, Sunday, October 20th at 02:10 pm PST, the site is still down. It has now been down for `12` days. However, the Wayback Machine began to come back up around 1:00 pm on 2024, October 15th (in a read-only state) while the Internet Archive is still completely inaccessible (although the Wayback Machine is also very slow at the moment) the Wayback Machine went back down again on 2024, Friday, October 19th, and is still down.
