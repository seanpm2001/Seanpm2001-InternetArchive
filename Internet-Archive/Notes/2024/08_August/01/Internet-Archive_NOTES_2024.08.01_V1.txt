Time-lapse showing how to butterfly a turkey.

Here is how I prepared our Thanksgiving turkey. I remove the legs & thighs and the backbone. Then I separate the drumstick from the thigh and then remove the bone from the thighs. Pound the meat and then add a layer of stuffing, roll them, and truss them. I simmer the gizzards, backbone, and neck while the turkey roasts on top of the stuffing. This was a 24 pound bird and normally would take nearly eight hours to roast with a light coating of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt, pepper, and poultry seasonings (the stuffing contains fresh herbs that infuse the meat from within. This method cuts the time in half. the bird roasts under foil and then the last half hour to 45 minutes uncovered to brown the skin. After cooking, I remove the breasts from the carcass, use the stock and pan drippings to make the gravy and slice the breasts and the 'thigh rolls' for easy serving - everyone gets a bit delicious crispy skin with their tender and juicy white or dark meat.
