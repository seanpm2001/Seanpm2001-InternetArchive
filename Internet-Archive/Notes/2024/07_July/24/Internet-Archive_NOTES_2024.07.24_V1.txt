Hurrians_Hurrian-Hymn-no.6_1400BCE

A song from the Hurrian people of ancient Syria, Mesopotamia, and Anatolia, dating to around 1400 BCE, and making this one of the oldest known surviving songs. This is a digital recreation.

Note: there is a video only (WebM) and an audio only (WebM) version in the original format that need to be merged. Separate audio only (MP3 and OGG) versions are also available.

Another note: The year is listed as 1, as I can't put the exact year of the song in the Internet Archive due to a technical limitation, and last time I chose year 0, it caused an error.
