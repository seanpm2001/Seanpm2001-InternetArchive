Archive.org doesn't give me the WARC file download option via email every time I request it. It has been very infrequent on failing to deliver in the beginning. Today, I again requested it on 3 different snapshots, and received no response. That is why this day has no entries. It has been a bit inconsistent on sending all 3 WARC files lately as well, and some are delayed by 6-18 hours each.
