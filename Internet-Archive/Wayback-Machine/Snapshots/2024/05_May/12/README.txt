Archive.org doesn't give me the WARC file download option via email every time I request it. It has been very infrequent on failing to deliver in the beginning. Today, I again requested it on 3 different snapshots, and again received no response. That is why this day has no entries. There were 7 consecutive days of the site doing this, until yesterday, where all 3 snapshots were generated. It went back to not sending a single snapshot again today.
