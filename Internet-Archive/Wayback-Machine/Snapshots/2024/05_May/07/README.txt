Archive.org doesn't give me the WARC file download option via email every time I request it. It has been very infrequent on failing to deliver lately. Today, I again requested it on 3 different snapshots, and again received no response. That is why this day has no entries. It was exactly the same as yesterday and te day before. This was the 4th consecutive day that it did this.

This issue seemed to start after one of my uploads was identified as spam. I had this corrected via an email to the Internet Archive, and feel the problem is unrelated, but it is still disappointing.
